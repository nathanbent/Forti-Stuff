# Forti-Stuff

> FortiScripts to make my FortiLife easier (sometimes)

## The Premise
I've been spending more time in the FortiGate CLI during deployments and migrations, and have been creating scripts to help with this process.

## The Stuff
These are fairly basic scripts to take a large input set and output them into FortiOS compatible format.

### Scripts
- Named lists to FortiOS (`named-list-2-fortios.py`)
- Bulk lists to be automatically named (`address-list-2-fortios.py`)

More coming soon
